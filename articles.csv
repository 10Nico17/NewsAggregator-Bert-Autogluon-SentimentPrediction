When the episode was done, he would receive another episode’s worth of footage, and so on, until he and two other editors worked through the TV season.
This model, which typically pays picture editors $125,000 to $200,000 a year, has mostly survived the shorter seasons of the streaming era, because editors can work on more than one show in a year.

Fed’s Preferred Inflation Measure Cooled Overall in June,"The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure continued to gradually cool overall in June even as a “core” inflation measure held steady, likely enough evidence of progress to keep the central bank on track for a rate cut later this year but not enough to stoke speculation that it might reduce rates at its meeting next week.
A “core” price measure that strips out food and fuel costs for a better sense of the underlying inflation trend proved slightly more stubborn.
Yearly core inflation was 2.6 percent, matching its reading in May.
And on a monthly basis, both measures of inflation climbed modestly.

Ms. Harris told the executives they needed to be lending more, faster, particularly to minority-owned businesses that data suggested were struggling to gain access to the money.
The calls represented one of the earliest and most visible forays Ms. Harris made in devising and carrying out the Biden administration’s economic agenda, and illustrated the sort of economic policy niche that she has filled as vice president.

"Senate Passes Child Online Safety Bill, Sending It to an Uncertain House Fate","The Senate on Tuesday passed bipartisan legislation to impose sweeping safety and privacy requirements for children and teens on social media and other technology platforms, voting overwhelmingly to send the measure to the House, where its fate was uncertain.
Passage of the measure, which has been the subject of a dogged advocacy campaign by parents who say their children lost their lives because of something they found or saw on social media, marked a rare bipartisan achievement at a time of deep polarization in Congress.
Despite the lopsided support among Republicans and Democrats, the package faces a fierce lobbying effort by technology companies that are resisting new regulation, and deep skepticism among free speech advocates who argue that it would chill individual expression and potentially harm some of those whom the bill aims to protect.
The vote was 91 to 3 to approve the measure, sending it to the House, which is in a summer recess until September.

The judge also found that Trump’s suggestions that Biden attempted to influence prosecutors was unfounded.
In her ruling Saturday, Chutkan rejected Trump’s arguments that the case in Washington was brought only because Trump pleaded not guilty to charges of mishandling classified information in Florida — a case that was recently dismissed.

U.S. Sues TikTok Over Child Privacy Violations,"The Justice Department sued TikTok on Friday, accusing it of illegally collecting children’s data and escalating a long-running battle between the U.S. government and the Chinese-owned app.

The company knowingly allowed children under 13 to create and use TikTok accounts, the government said, and frequently failed to honor parents’ requests to delete their children’s accounts.
The lawsuit, which was filed in a federal court in Southern California, said those practices violated both the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, a law that restricts the online tracking of children, and a 2019 agreement between TikTok and the government in which the company pledged to notify parents before collecting children’s data and remove videos from users under 13 years old.

“There is no Delaware law on this, correct?”The lawyer, David E. Ross, acknowledged there was no exact precedent for having shareholders overturn a judge’s decision in similar cases.
